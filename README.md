# Property Management System

## Project Summary
The **Property Management System** is a web application designed to manage real estate properties. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for property listings, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete properties. The system also supports pagination and search functionality to filter properties by address, price, and size.

The application is deployed on AWS using two EC2 instances: one for the backend and frontend, and another for the MySQL database. The backend, built with Spring Boot, handles the business logic and exposes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. The MySQL database stores all property-related data and is accessed by the backend

### Key Features:
- **Create Property**: Add new property listings with details such as address, price, size, and description.
- **Read Property**: View a list of all properties or search for specific properties using filters.
- **Update Property**: Modify existing property details.
- **Delete Property**: Remove properties from the system.
- **Pagination**: Browse properties in pages for better usability.
- **Search**: Filter properties by address, price range, and size.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following software installed on your local machine:

- **Java 17+**: The project is built using Java. 
- **Maven**: Used for dependency management.
- **IDE (optional)**: An Integrated Development Environment like IntelliJ IDEA can be used for development.

### Installing

Follow these steps to get the development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nat15005/AREP_CRUD_SYSTEM.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd AREP_CRUD_SYSTEM
   ```
3. **Build the project using Maven:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Server

Once the project is built, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
java -cp target/classes arep.crudsystem.Application
```

The server will start and listen on port `8080`.

### Accessing the Application

Open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

You should see the main page of the application.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into three main components:

1. *Frontend:* Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the property management system. üåê

2. *Backend:* Implemented with Spring Boot, it exposes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on properties. The backend handles all the business logic and communicates with the database. üõ†Ô∏è

3. *Database:* MySQL is used to store property data. The database is accessed via JPA/Hibernate in the backend, ensuring seamless data persistence and retrieval. üóÉÔ∏è

### Deployment on AWS EC2 Instances ‚òÅÔ∏è

The system is deployed on two separate EC2 instances for better performance and security:

- *EC2 Instance 1:* Hosts the Frontend and Backend (Spring Boot application). This instance runs the web application and handles user requests. üñ•Ô∏è

   - The frontend sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend.

   - The backend processes these requests and interacts with the database.

- *EC2 Instance 2:* Hosts the MySQL Database. This instance is dedicated to storing and managing property data. üóÑÔ∏è

   - The backend communicates with the database via JDBC to perform CRUD operations.

   - The database stores and retrieves property data as requested by the backend.
  
### Interaction Flow üîÑ
Frontend ‚Üí Backend: The frontend sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend. üì§

Backend ‚Üí Database: The backend processes the requests, performs the necessary operations, and interacts with the MySQL database. üõ†Ô∏è

Database ‚Üí Backend: The database stores and retrieves property data as requested by the backend. üì•

Backend ‚Üí Frontend: The backend sends responses back to the frontend, which displays the results to the user. üì§


## Class Design

The main classes in the system are:

üè† Property (Model)
- Description: Represents a property entity in the system. This class is mapped to the properties table in the database using JPA annotations.

- Attributes:

   - id: The unique identifier for the property (auto-generated by the database).

   - address: The address of the property (required).

   - price: The price of the property (required).

   - size: The size of the property (e.g., in square meters, required).

   - description: A description of the property (optional).

- Functionality: This class is used to store and retrieve property data from the database.

üéõÔ∏è PropertyController (Controller)
- Description: This is the REST controller that handles HTTP requests for CRUD operations on properties. It exposes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting properties, as well as searching and pagination.

- Key Endpoints:

   - GET /api/properties: Retrieves a paginated list of all properties.

   - GET /api/properties/search: Searches for properties based on filters (address, price, size) and returns paginated results.

   - GET /api/properties/{id}: Retrieves a single property by its ID.

   - POST /api/properties: Creates a new property.

   - PUT /api/properties/{id}: Updates an existing property.

   - DELETE /api/properties/{id}: Deletes a property by its ID.

- Functionality: Acts as the interface between the frontend and the backend, processing requests and returning appropriate responses.

üõ†Ô∏è PropertyService (Service)

- Description: This class contains the business logic for managing properties. It interacts with the PropertyRepository to perform CRUD operations, pagination, and search functionality.

- Key Methods:

   - getAllProperties(int page, int size): Retrieves a paginated list of all properties.

   - searchProperties(String query, Double maxPrice, Double maxSize, int page, int size): Searches for properties based on filters and returns paginated results.

   - getPropertyById(Long id): Retrieves a property by its ID.

   - createProperty(Property property): Creates a new property.

   - updateProperty(Long id, Property propertyDetails): Updates an existing property.

   - deleteProperty(Long id): Deletes a property by its ID.

- Functionality: Handles the core logic for property management and ensures data consistency.

üóÑÔ∏è PropertyRepository (Repository)

- Description: This interface extends JpaRepository and provides CRUD operations for the Property entity. It also includes a custom query method for searching properties based on filters.

- Key Method:

   - search(String query, Double maxPrice, Double maxSize, Pageable pageable): Searches for properties based on address, price, and size filters, and returns paginated results.

- Functionality: Acts as the data access layer, interacting directly with the database to perform CRUD operations and custom queries.
